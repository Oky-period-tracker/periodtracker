# Period tracker

Oky is the world’s first period tracker app that was made with girls' input.

It provides important information about menstruation in fun, creative, and positive ways. And it brings it straight into girls’ hands through the tool they use most often every day – mobile phones.

Oky lets girls feel in control and more confident by tracking their periods, and getting information that all girls should have access to.
