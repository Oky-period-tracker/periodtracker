When a transgender person goes through the process of becoming the gender they feel on the inside, it''s called ''transitioning''. 

Transitioning includes 2 steps:

1. Social transition: telling your friends and family, dressing differently and changing your name, legal gender and pronouns (for example, asking people to call you he/him)

2. Medical transition: taking hormones and getting surgery to physically change how you look to match the gender you feel inside

Being intersex is just a physical feature that forms as the baby is developing, like one person having green eyes and another brown eyes. It''s NOT a disease. 

Sometimes people get confused between intersex and transgender. Transgender people feel that their gender is different from the sex of their body.

Transgender people sometimes feel like they were ''born with the wrong body''.

A trans man (or transgender man) is a person who feels inside that they''re a man, but who was born with a female body. A trans woman or a transgender woman is a person who feels inside that they''re a woman, but who was born with a male body.

This comes from what''s called ''gender identity'' - how you feel inside regardless of the sex of your body.

Transgender is one gender identity. ''Cisgender'' and ''non-binary'' are also gender identities.

Being cisgender means that the gender (male or female) that you feel you are inside, is the same as the sex of your body. So, a person with a female body who also feels inside that she is a woman, is cisgender.

A person who is non-binary feels inside that they''re not only male or only female, but a blend of both (or neither one). 

Some other words people with a non-binary gender identity use to describe themselves include:

- ''Gender non-conforming'' -  a person who expresses their gender in a way that''s different from the way they''re expected to express it. They don''t follow traditional gender norms.
- ''Genderqueer'' -  a person who feels that they''re neither male nor female, but between or beyond genders.
- ''Gender fluid'' - a person whose gender varies over time.
- ''Gender neutral'' - a person who feels they''re neither male or female.

Parents can think that marrying their daughter young will keep her, her virginity, and the family''s honor safe. For example, if a girl gets pregnant before marriage, the parents might see marriage as the only solution.

In some places, child marriage has been done for so long that it just seems normal. 

Boys can also be married as children, but it happens much less. Almost no boys are married before they''re 15. 

Having laws against child marriage is a big step in making it stop happening, or happen less. 

Sadly, having a law that says something isn''t allowed, doesn''t always mean that it doesn''t happen anymore.

In some countries, it is legal to get married under 18, but this is still child marriage.

Even in countries where child marriage is legal, a forced or arranged marriage is a violation of a child''s rights.

Why? 

Firstly, because everyone has the right to choose if, when and who they marry — and children don''t have that choice.

Children also have the right to education, health, equality and a life without violence, but child marriage often prevents them from getting those things.

Children who marry usually leave school, which makes it difficult for them to find good jobs and to make enough money. This limits their future.

Married girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. 

Child brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. 

When married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.

Child brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.

Finally, the children of child brides are also affected. Babies born to teenage mothers are also more likely to die soon after being born, and if they survive, are often less educated.', '1', 'en'), ('4e956a89-5e3c-4cad-8374-7968bd80667a', '84c1a3d4-4668-4219-9412-1bad9abf71d5', '0cfddc99-a8bd-46a9-bb81-1a9da84f21b6', 'How can I communicate my feelings to other people?', 'Communicating your feelings, especially private ones, can be hard!

You should talk to someone as soon as possible. This could be a family member, friend, counsellor, doctor or support service. Check Oky''s Help Center for organizations to contact. 

Some other thing you can do:

- Develop a safety plan. If you''ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, plan ahead for how to manage them if they come up again

- Postpone any decision to end your life for 24 hours. Use this time to talk to someone you trust

- Avoid being alone, especially at night. Stay with someone until the thoughts of hurting yourself don''t feel so strong

- Don''t drink or take drugs. These are what''s called ''depressants'' and actually make you feel worse, even if you feel better for a short time

- Write down how you feel. Writing in a journal or writing a story, song or poem can help you to understand your feelings better and find solutions

- Challenge your thoughts. Remember that, just like other thoughts, suicidal thoughts will come and go and thinking something doesn''t make it true.

- Write down what is keeping you from acting on suicidal thoughts. Remind yourself that there are things that you still want to do. Even tiny things make life worth living.

Self-harm can also include less violent things, like taking a lot of drugs, drinking too much, or eating too much or too little.

People often try to keep it a secret, but it''s quite common, especially for teenagers. That doesn''t mean it''s OK!

- Let your friend know that if they feel down or stressed, they can talk to you

- Tell your friend you''re worried about them, and why.If your friend seems angry or upset, it''s probably because they feel ashamed and are scared to stop. People learn to rely on self-harming to cope with life''s struggles
