This could be a family member, friend, counsellor, doctor or support service. Check PeriodTracker's Help Center for organizations to contact. \r\n\r\nSome other thing you can do:\r\n\r\n- Develop a safety plan. If you've had suicidal thoughts in the past, plan ahead for how to manage them if they come up again\r\n\r\n- Postpone any decision to end your life for 24 hours. Use this time to talk to someone you trust\r\n\r\n- Avoid being alone, especially at night. Stay with someone until the thoughts of hurting yourself don't feel so strong\r\n\r\n- Don't drink or take drugs. These are what's called 'depressants' and actually make you feel worse, even if you feel better for a short time\r\n\r\n- Write down how you feel. Writing in a journal or writing a story, song or poem can help you to understand your feelings better and find solutions\r\n\r\n- Challenge your thoughts. Remember that, just like other thoughts, suicidal thoughts will come and go and thinking something doesn't make it true.\r\n\r\n- Write down what is keeping you from acting on suicidal thoughts. Remind yourself that there are things that you still want to do. Even tiny things make life worth living.\r\n\r\n- Set small goals for yourself. Set goals that will make you feel in control and move forward. Write them down and check them off when you achieve them.\r\n\r\n- Talk to someone who can help.

          "It can happen for many reasons. \r\n\r\nIf the family is poor, it means 1 less person to feed, clothe and educate.\r\n\r\nThey might think that investing in their sons’ education is more worthwhile since sons will stay and support them, whereas daughters will go to live with their husbands’ families.\r\n\r\nParents can think that marrying their daughter young will keep her, her virginity, and the family’s honor safe. For example, if a girl gets pregnant before marriage, the parents might see marriage as the only solution.\r\n\r\nIn some places, child marriage has been done for so long that it just seems normal. \r\n\r\nBoys can also be married as children, but it happens much less. Almost no boys are married before they're 15. \r\n\r\nHaving laws against child marriage is a big step in making it stop happening, or happen less. \r\n\r\nSadly, having a law that says something isn't allowed, doesn't always mean that it doesn't happen anymore.\r\n\r\nFor laws to work, family, communities and the authorities (like police, or the government) need to know about the law, understand it, follow it and make sure there are serious consequences when the law isn't followed.",

          "When anyone gets married are under 18, it's called child marriage, and it's not okay.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, it is legal to get married under 18, but this is still child marriage.\r\n\r\nEven in countries where child marriage is legal, a forced or arranged marriage is a violation of a child's rights.\r\n\r\nWhy? \r\n\r\nFirstly, because everyone has the right to choose if, when and who they marry — and children don't have that choice.\r\n\r\nChildren also have the right to education, health, equality and a life without violence, but child marriage often prevents them from getting those things.\r\n\r\nChildren who marry usually leave school, which makes it difficult for them to find good jobs and to make enough money. This limits their future.\r\n\r\nMarried girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. \r\n\r\nChild brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. \r\n\r\nWhen married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.\r\n\r\nChild brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.\r\n\r\nFinally, the children of child brides are also affected. Babies born to teenage mothers are also more likely to die soon after being born, and if they survive, are often less educated. ",

Make a complaint to the National Commission on Human Rights in your country, which is there to protect, develop, and promote human rights in the constitution and in the treaties that your country signed\r\n\r\n5. Speak to a lawyer, a legal services group (who can help you get a lawyer) or an NGO to see if you can take your case to court\r\n\r\n6. If you're willing to speak out in public, reach out to the media. For example, Malala Yousafzai became internationally famous for drawing attention to girls rights' abuses in Pakistan\r\n\r\n7.

For example, you could have children from former relationships with someone of the opposite sex, adoption, artificial insemination (which is when a man’s sperm is put into the woman’s vagina without having sex) or surrogacy (which is when a woman carries a baby for someone else, for example, using the sperm of one of the members of a gay couple).",

When you have sex, the penis goes into the vagina, and if the man ejaculates (without a condom on), the semen swims through the vagina and into the womb.\r\n\r\nThe cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb, at the top of the vagina. Period blood passes from the womb, through the cervix into the vagina. After sex (without a condom), semen passes through the cervix, into the womb. During birth, the cervix stretches open, allowing the baby to pass through. During sex, the penis doesn't go any further than the cervix. \r\n\r\nThe womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is empty inside. It is connected to the fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period.\r\n\r\nThe fallopian tubes are 2 very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube. The egg and sperm meet in 1 of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb.\r\n\r\nThe 2 ovaries are the size of grapes. They are on each side of the womb or uterus near the end of the fallopian tubes. They make female hormones, and are where women's eggs grow.",

We hope this makes it simpler for you to enter your period information when you sign up.\r\n \r\nEven if you enter the wrong information at first, PeriodTracker is smart and will learn to track your period.
