# Oky Period tracker

Oky is the world’s first period tracker app that was made with girls' input.

It provides important information about menstruation in fun, creative, and positive ways. And it brings it straight into girls’ hands through the tool they use most often every day – mobile phones.

Oky lets girls feel in control and more confident by tracking their periods, and getting information that all girls should have access to.

# Oky's Features

# Oky's Principles

- :girl: Girl-led design

  > Oky was designed with input from girls in Mongolia and Indonesia, ensuring it stays relevant by letting those who would benefit most shape its design, features, and name.

- :video_game: Gamified Approach

  > Oky is a girl-centered app that combines gamification for fun learning and discreet period tracking. Users can personalize avatars, unlock features, play quizzes, and enjoy positive, stigma-free content.

- :girl:Design for girls digital realities

  > Oky is lightweight, offline-friendly, supports shared phones, and has secure passcode protection, all tailored to girls' contexts and languages.

- :heavy_check_mark:Evidence-based content

  > Oky provides expert-vetted, girl-friendly information on menstruation, puberty, and reproductive health, along with referrals to support services.

- :open_hands:Open source

  > Oky’s open-source code and content are free to access, fostering co-creation and a global community. The code is available on GitHub under the AGPL-3.0 License, and content can be requested.

- :free:Accessible and inclusive

  > Oky is designed with input from girls with disabilities and follows accessibility guidelines to ensure wide reach. Partners also receive expert guidance on inclusion and best practices. <!-- what accesibility guidelines were/are followed?-->

- :lock:Private and secure
  > Oky prioritizes privacy by not collecting personal information. It’s password-protected, stores data locally, works offline, and only saves non-identifiable data and historic cycle dates online for cross-device access.
