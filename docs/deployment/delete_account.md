# Delete PeriodTracker Account

A simple web page for users to delete their PeriodTracker account.

Create your own delete-account [submodule](../modules.md)

Change the value in `config.js` to point to your own API endpoint.

You can host this page on GitHub pages or any other static hosting service.

For github pages, go to `Settings > Code and automation > Pages`. Select the branch to use and the root folder, then add your subdomain, eg `delete-account.example.com`.

Add a CNAME record to your DNS provider to point to your github pages domain: `<user>.github.io`.
