## Tests

We are using Jest for testing.

These tests are important and should not be skipped. They test some of the most important parts of the app, such as authentication, prediction, and the integrity of the hardcoded data.

Some of the tests will fail if you have not first compiled the code. To clean and compile, run these commands:

```bash
yarn clean
yarn compile
```

To run the tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```
