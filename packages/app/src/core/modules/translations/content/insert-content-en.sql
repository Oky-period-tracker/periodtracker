2. How easy is it to use? The easiest methods to use are the contraceptive injection, implant, and IUD because after you get them, you don''t need to remember anything until the next time it needs to be replaced/injected. If you pick the implant or IUD, you can use it for years!

The most common way people self-harm is by cutting themselves. Some people bang or hit their heads, burn or scratch themselves, punch themselves or other things, pull out their hair or pick at wounds to prevent them from healing.

Self-harm can also include less violent things, like taking a lot of drugs, drinking too much, or eating too much or too little.

Most people who self-harm feel shame and guilt about hurting themselves, but find it hard to stop. 

People often try to keep it a secret, but it''s quite common, especially for teenagers. That doesn''t mean it''s OK!

Hurting yourself or thinking about hurting yourself is a sign that something is wrong emotionally.

It''s important to learn healthy ways to cope with emotional pain.

The first step is to talk to a parent, trusted adult, psychologist or counsellor. Check PeriodTracker''s Health Center for organizations you can contact.

If you think a friend may be self-harming, you can:

- Let your friend know that if they feel down or stressed, they can talk to you

- Tell your friend you''re worried about them, and why.If your friend seems angry or upset, it’s probably because they feel ashamed and are scared to stop. People learn to rely on self-harming to cope with life''s struggles

- Encourage your friend to seek help from their parent, a counsellor or doctor or another adult they trust

- If you''re worried for your friend’s safety and decide you need to tell an adult, let your friend know before you say anything

- Challenge your thoughts. Remember that, just like other thoughts, suicidal thoughts will come and go and thinking something doesn''t make it true.

- Write down what is keeping you from acting on suicidal thoughts. Remind yourself that there are things that you still want to do. Even tiny things make life worth living.

Parents can think that marrying their daughter young will keep her, her virginity, and the family’s honor safe. For example, if a girl gets pregnant before marriage, the parents might see marriage as the only solution.

In some countries, it is legal to get married under 18, but this is still child marriage.

Even in countries where child marriage is legal, a forced or arranged marriage is a violation of a child''s rights.

Why? 

Firstly, because everyone has the right to choose if, when and who they marry — and children don''t have that choice.

Children also have the right to education, health, equality and a life without violence, but child marriage often prevents them from getting those things.

Children who marry usually leave school, which makes it difficult for them to find good jobs and to make enough money. This limits their future.

Married girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. 

Child brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. 

When married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.

Child brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.

Finally, the children of child brides are also affected. Babies born to teenage mothers are also more likely to die soon after being born, and if they survive, are often less educated.

Transgender people sometimes feel like they were ''born with the wrong body''.

A trans man feels inside that they''re a man but they were born with a female body. A trans woman feels that they''re a woman but they were born with a male body. 

This comes from what''s called ''gender identity'' — how you feel inside, regardless of the sex of your body. Transgender is one gender identity. ''Cisgender'' and ''non-binary'' are also gender identities. 

Being cisgender means that the gender that you feel you are is the same as the sex of your body. A person who is non-binary feels inside that they''re not only male or only female, but a blend of both (or neither one). 

Some other words people with a non-binary gender identity use to describe themselves include:

- ''Gender non-conforming'': a person who expresses their gender in a way that''s different from the way they''re expected to 

- ''Genderqueer'': a person who feels that they''re neither male nor female, but between or beyond genders

- ''Gender fluid'': a person whose gender changes over time

- ''Gender neutral'': a person who feels they''re neither male or female

When a transgender person goes through the process of becoming the gender they feel on the inside, it''s called ''transitioning''. 

Transitioning includes 2 steps:

1. Social transition: telling your friends and family, dressing differently and changing your name, legal gender and pronouns (for example, asking people to call you he/him)

2. Medical transition: taking hormones and getting surgery to physically change how you look to match the gender you feel inside

Period blood leaves your body through the vagina, and so do babies. When you have sex, the penis goes into the vagina, and if the man ejaculates (without a condom on), the semen swims through the vagina and into the womb.

The cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb, at the top of the vagina. Period blood passes from the womb, through the cervix into the vagina. After sex (without a condom), semen passes through the cervix, into the womb. During birth, the cervix stretches open, allowing the baby to pass through. During sex, the penis doesn''t go any further than the cervix. 

The womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is empty inside. It is connected to the fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period.

The fallopian tubes are 2 very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube. The egg and sperm meet in 1 of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb.

The opening to the vagina is the hole that period blood and babies come out of, and where a penis goes in during vaginal sex. Women have 3 holes: the urethra is a small hole which pee comes out of, then the vagina is in the middle, then the anus at the back (where poo comes out of).

Sexual abusers can be anyone. They are usually straight men, but they can also be female. Almost all sexual abusers are people the victim knows, not strangers.

You can''t control what other people do, but you can try and protect yourself by: 

- Trusting your feelings. If you feel something is ''weird'' when you''re with someone, leave — even if nothing sexual has happened

- Trying not to be alone with someone who makes you feel uncomfortable

- Ignoring anyone who threatens to gossip or lie about you unless you do what they want 

- Avoiding sharing naked pictures of yourself

Sexual assault is when you haven''t agreed to do something, or you can''t agree because you''re drunk, high on drugs, asleep or unconscious, or because you don''t understand. 

Any sexual behavior with someone who who is legally too young to consent (agree) is sexual abuse, even if you say yes.

Sexual abuse can come from someone you trust — a father, brother, uncle or family friend — or a stranger. They may tell you to keep it secret but it is important to tell a parent or teacher.

If you think you''ve been sexually assaulted or abused, talk to someone you trust. Sometimes just confiding in someone is enough to make you feel better, but if you want to make sure that person doesn''t hurt you or others again, you might decide to report them.

- Contact an organization that works on violence against women and girls for advice and help. Check PeriodTracker''s Help Center for details.

- Ask your school or work to provide education to everyone on sexual harassment

- Organize a speaker on sexual harassment to come to your school or work

- Campaign for a policy on sexual harassment for your school or work if there is not something already in place

- Document it by taking screenshots. If you decide to report them, you''ll need evidence. Make sure you save their social media profile details, email, phone number or anything else you have

- Report the threats to the police

- Block them so they can’t see your photos, and won''t be able to chat with you or see what you post

- Don''t try to handle the situation by yourself. If you''re under 18, talk with a parent or adult you trust to help you decide what to do

Sexual harassment can include:
