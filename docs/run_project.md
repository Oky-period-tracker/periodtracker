# Run the project locally

How to get the project running locally once everything has been set up

This command starts metro for the react native app, as well as the CMS and API

```bash
yarn dev
```

For mobile only development, you can instead use this command to start metro without the CMS and API

```bash
yarn dev:mobile
```

Once metro is running, you can start the on android by running

```bash
yarn run:android
```
