          "The testicles are the 2 balls inside the scrotum (which is a bag of skin) that sit between men's legs, under the penis. They are the size of 2 small eggs and make hormones and sperm.\n\nThe epididymis is a tiny, tightly coiled tube, that sits on top of each testicle where sperm get ready to be released.\n\nThe vas deferens are two long, thin tubes that start at the epididymis and go all the way to the urethra. Sperm from the epididymis travel through them.\n\nThe seminal vesicles are 2 small glands that make fluid. When sperm get to the seminal vesicles, they mix with this fluid, which feeds and protects them.\n\nThe prostate gland makes a thin, milky fluid that mixes with sperm and the fluid from the seminal vesicles to make semen.\n\nThe urethra is a thin tube that goes from the bladder through the penis. It carries pee and semen out of the body.\n\nThere are 2 Cowper’s glands near the urethra that make a fluid called pre-ejaculate (which comes out just before ejaculation) which acts as a natural lubricant during sex.

Its only purpose is to give pleasure!\n\nThe opening to the vagina is the hole that period blood and babies come out of, and where a penis goes in during vaginal sex. Women have 3 holes: the urethra is a small hole which pee comes out of, then the vagina is in the middle, then the anus at the back (where poo comes out of).\n\n- The hymen is a thin piece of skin that covers part of the opening to the vagina in some girls.

          "The vagina is a stretchy passageway that leads from a small opening between your legs to your womb (also called a uterus). Period blood leaves your body through the vagina, and so do babies. When you have sex, the penis goes into the vagina, and if the man ejaculates (without a condom on), the semen swims through the vagina and into the womb.\n\nThe cervix is the lower, narrow end of the womb, at the top of the vagina. Period blood passes from the womb, through the cervix into the vagina. After sex (without a condom), semen passes through the cervix, into the womb. During birth, the cervix stretches open, allowing the baby to pass through. During sex, the penis doesn't go any further than the cervix. \n\nThe womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is empty inside. It is connected to the fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period.\n\nThe fallopian tubes are 2 very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube. The egg and sperm meet in 1 of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb.\n\nThe 2 ovaries are the size of grapes. They are on each side of the womb or uterus near the end of the fallopian tubes. They make female hormones, and are where women's eggs grow.",

Progesterone peaks can make you feel relaxed, and lows can make you feel anxious.\n\nWhen you’re on your period, cramping, pain, diarrhea and nausea may affect your mood.\n\nAfter your period, estrogen levels peak as you prepare for ovulation (releasing an egg from your ovaries). You might feel motivated and confident. \n\nAfter ovulation, progesterone rises to its peak. You might feel calm and less anxious. \n\nRight before your next period, in the premenstrual phase, estrogen and progesterone drops can lead to mood swings, fatigue and anxiety.',

For example, you could have children from former relationships with someone of the opposite sex, adoption, artificial insemination (which is when a man’s sperm is put into the woman’s vagina without having sex) or surrogacy (which is when a woman carries a baby for someone else, for example, using the sperm of one of the members of a gay couple).",

Even if it's a picture of yourself.\n\nIf someone you like asks you to share a private photo or video, tell them that it makes you feel uncomfortable. \n\nIf they really care about you, they'll understand. If anyone tries to threaten you into sharing anything, say no and block them. Document it by taking a screenshot. \n\nIf it continues, tell someone you trust, contact the police or check Oky's Help Center for a list of organizations who can help you. ",

This limits their future.\n\nMarried girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. \n\nChild brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. \n\nWhen married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.\n\nChild brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.\n\nFinally, the children of child brides are also affected.

You can wear a tampon overnight, but put it in right before bed and change it as soon as you wake up.",

          "💬Zamira learned about menstruation from her mother and a friend. But when her period started, she was still scared! She didn't have the courage to tell her mother as she felt embarrassed. \n\n🌟Periods are natural and healthy! You shouldn't feel embarassed or ashamed. It's a good ida to talk with friends or your mother about your periods if you can. But if you're not comfortable asking questions yet, you can always read about periods and puberty in Oky.",

          '💬Aybek first got her period when she was 11 years old. She was playing with her friends in her village, and her mother was not home. "I was really scared because I was in public with my friends". When her mother returned to hear this, she felt guilty for not telling Aybek about menstruation sooner.\n\n🌟Having your first period in public can be scary! But periods are normal and healthy, and your friends should help you if you are scared. It\'s good to talk to your mother as she can also help. If you want to learn more about menstruation and managing periods, have a look at the Oky Encyclopedia. There is lots of information there - your friends may find it useful too!',
