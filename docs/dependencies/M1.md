### Python

You may encounter errors that include the message `python not found`

2. If python version 2 is installed, run following command to update it:

```
brew upgrade python
```

If you face following error:

`Error: Cannot install under Rosetta 2 in ARM default prefix (/opt/homebrew)!`
`To rerun under ARM use:`
`arch -arm64 brew install ...`
`To install under x86_64, install Homebrew into /usr/local.`

run this command to update python:

```
arch -arm64 brew upgrade python
```

3. Edit zshrc

Open the file with nano

```bash
nano  ~/.zshrc
```

Add one of these lines, make sure that the path matches the actual version of python you have installed

```.zshrc
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/libexec/bin:$PATH"
# or
alias python='/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/bin/python3'

### Port 5000 already in use

The CMS runs on port 5000, on M1 macs you will get an error about that port already being in use. This is because by default it is being used by Airplay receiver.

To solve this go to:
System preferences > Sharing > Uncheck Airplay Receiver
