You are fertile (meaning you can get pregnant) for about 5 days before ovulation and 1 day after.  \n\nFor pre-ovulation, it is usually between 13-18 days but can be as short as 8 days or as long as 31 days, depending on your cycle. \n\nFor post-ovulation, this starts after ovulation and ends the day before your next period.

Period blood passes from the womb, through the cervix into the vagina. After sex (without a condom), semen passes through the cervix, into the womb. During birth, the cervix stretches open, allowing the baby to pass through. During sex, the penis doesn't go any further than the cervix. \n\nThe womb is made of strong, stretchy muscles and is empty inside. It is connected to the fallopian tubes at the top, and to the vagina at the bottom. It is where a baby grows during pregnancy. It has a lining that gets thick with blood and tissue during your menstrual cycle, and then trickles out during your period.\n\nThe fallopian tubes are 2 very narrow tubes at the top of the womb or uterus that lead towards the ovaries. Their ends are like fingers (called fimbria) that pull the egg from the ovary into the tube. The egg and sperm meet in 1 of the fallopian tubes and then travel to the womb.\n\nThe 2 ovaries are the size of grapes. They are on each side of the womb or uterus near the end of the fallopian tubes. They make female hormones, and are where women's eggs grow.`,

        content: `The testicles are the 2 balls inside the scrotum (which is a bag of skin) that sit between men's legs, under the penis. They are the size of 2 small eggs and make hormones and sperm.\n\nThe epididymis is a tiny, tightly coiled tube, that sits on top of each testicle where sperm get ready to be released. \n\nThe vas deferens are two long, thin tubes that start at the epididymis and go all the way to the urethra. Sperm from the epididymis travel through them. \n\nThe seminal vesicles are 2 small glands that make fluid. When sperm get to the seminal vesicles, they mix with this fluid, which feeds and protects them. \n\nThe prostate gland makes a thin, milky fluid that mixes with sperm and the fluid from the seminal vesicles to make semen. \n\nThe urethra is a thin tube that goes from the bladder through the penis. It carries pee and semen out of the body.\n\nThere are 2 Cowper’s glands near the urethra that make a fluid called pre-ejaculate (which comes out just before ejaculation) which acts as a natural lubricant during sex.`,

          "During puberty, your brain sends messages to different organs to start making hormones which cause your body to develop. \n\nPhysically, most girls will develop in this order: \n\n– Breast growth, often on one side first, for about 2 years\n\n– Hair growth on the genitals, usually a few months later\n\n– The wall of the vagina gets thicker and the uterus and ovaries get bigger (you won't feel this, of course)\n\n– Periods begin, usually 2—3 years after breast growth starts, meaning girls can now become pregnant\n\n– The amount of discharge from the vagina increases\n\n– Underarm hair grows and sweat has a stronger smell\n\n– Girls grow taller, often suddenly\n\n– Hips can get wider\n\n– Voices can get a bit lower\n\n– Skin can become oilier, sometimes causing pimples or acne",

When you make a new friend, it can feel like having a crush because you like them so much and want to spend all your time with them!\n\nCrushes can sometimes feel like love — as you grow up it will become easier to spot the difference between a crush and love.`,

It's NOT a disease. \n\nSometimes people get confused between intersex and transgender. Transgender people feel that their gender is different from the sex of their body. An intersex person might have physical characteristics of the opposite sex, but doesn't necessarily feel like they have a different gender.`,

        content: `Being transgender means that the gender (male or female) that you feel you are in your brain, is different from the sex of your body.\n\nTransgender people sometimes feel like they were 'born with the wrong body'.\n\nA trans man (or transgender man) is a person who feels inside that they're a man, but who was born with a female body. A trans woman or a transgender woman is a person who feels inside that they're a woman, but who was born with a male body.\n\nThis comes from what's called 'gender identity' - how you feel inside regardless of the sex of your body.\n\nTransgender is one gender identity. 'Cisgender' and 'non-binary' are also gender identities.\n\nBeing cisgender means that the gender (male or female) that you feel you are inside, is the same as the sex of your body. So, a person with a female body who also feels inside that she is a woman, is cisgender.\n\nA person who is non-binary feels inside that they're not only male or only female, but a blend of both (or neither one). \n\nSome other words people with a non-binary gender identity use to describe themselves include:\n\n- 'Gender non-conforming' -  a person who expresses their gender in a way that's different from the way they're expected to express it. They don't follow traditional gender norms.\n- 'Genderqueer' -  a person who feels that they're neither male nor female, but between or beyond genders.\n- 'Gender fluid' - a person whose gender varies over time.\n- 'Gender neutral' - a person who feels they're neither male or female.\n- 'Agender' - a person who feels they don't have a gender.`,

        content: `When anyone gets married are under 18, it's called child marriage, and it's not okay.\n\nIn some countries, it is legal to get married under 18, but this is still child marriage.\n\nEven in countries where child marriage is legal, a forced or arranged marriage is a violation of a child's rights.\n\nWhy? \n\nFirstly, because everyone has the right to choose if, when and who they marry — and children don't have that choice.\n\nChildren also have the right to education, health, equality and a life without violence, but child marriage often prevents them from getting those things.\n\nChildren who marry usually leave school, which makes it difficult for them to find good jobs and to make enough money. This limits their future.\n\nMarried girls are likely to become pregnant before their bodies have finished growing, which puts their health and life at risk. \n\nChild brides are also more likely to experience violence in their marriage. \n\nWhen married girls are abused, it can be more difficult for them to leave the abusive marriage because of their age and lack of life experience, and the abuse can cause mental health problems.\n\nChild brides might also be isolated, and have little power, especially if their husbands are older than them, which happens a lot.\n\nFinally, the children of child brides are also affected. Babies born to teenage mothers are also more likely to die soon after being born, and if they survive, are often less educated.`,

But it's totally worth it because it can improve the quality of your relationships.\n\nHere's what you can do to make it a bit easier:\n\n- Name your feelings and identify them. Google 'feelings wheel' to help you pinpoint exactly what you're feeling\n\n- Look under the surface for what's really going on.

But you're not alone — 1 in 5 people will have suicidal thoughts at some point in their life.\n\nSometimes life can be so overwhelming, it's sometimes impossible to believe that anything will get better.\n\nBut many people who have thought about suicide found that those feelings did go away with time, and they were glad they didn't do it.\n\nYou should talk to someone as soon as possible. This could be a family member, friend, counsellor, doctor or support service. Check Oky's Help Center for organizations to contact. \n\nSome other thing you can do:\n\n- Develop a safety plan. If you've had suicidal thoughts in the past, plan ahead for how to manage them if they come up again\n\n- Postpone any decision to end your life for 24 hours. Use this time to talk to someone you trust\n\n- Avoid being alone, especially at night. Stay with someone until the thoughts of hurting yourself don't feel so strong\n\n- Don't drink or take drugs. These are what's called 'depressants' and actually make you feel worse, even if you feel better for a short time\n\n- Write down how you feel. Writing in a journal or writing a story, song or poem can help you to understand your feelings better and find solutions\n\n- Challenge your thoughts. Remember that, just like other thoughts, suicidal thoughts will come and go and thinking something doesn't make it true.\n\n- Write down what is keeping you from acting on suicidal thoughts. Remind yourself that there are things that you still want to do. Even tiny things make life worth living.\n\n- Set small goals for yourself. Set goals that will make you feel in control and move forward. Write them down and check them off when you achieve them.\n\n- Talk to someone who can help. That advice is so important Oky is mentioning it twice!`,

That doesn't mean it's OK!\n\nHurting yourself or thinking about hurting yourself is a sign that something is wrong emotionally.\n\nIt's important to learn healthy ways to cope with emotional pain.\n\nThe first step is to talk to a parent, trusted adult, psychologist or counsellor. Check Oky's Health Center for organizations you can contact.\n\nIf you think a friend may be self-harming, you can:\n\n- Let your friend know that if they feel down or stressed, they can talk to you\n\n- Tell your friend you're worried about them, and why.If your friend seems angry or upset, it's probably because they feel ashamed and are scared to stop. People learn to rely on self-harming to cope with life's struggles\n\n- Encourage your friend to seek help from their parent, a counsellor or doctor or another adult they trust\n\n- If you're worried for your friend's safety and decide you need to tell an adult, let your friend know before you say anything\n\n- Continue being their friend by showing support, doing the things you enjoy doing together, and letting your friend know that you accept them for who they are`,
